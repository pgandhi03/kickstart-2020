Problem
There are N houses for sale. The i-th house costs Ai dollars to buy. You have a budget of B dollars to spend.
What is the maximum number of houses you can buy?


Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a single line containing the two integers N and B. The second line contains N integers. The i-th integer is Ai, the cost of the i-th house.

Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the maximum number of houses you can buy.
